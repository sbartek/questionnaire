# Proust Questionnaire

In this project I implement a bit silly Proust Questionnaire:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proust_Questionnaire

this way everyone can compare his answers with the ones given by
Proust.

At first it will work on terminal and I will try BDD using Minitest.

Directory /doc include a photo of class model structure and prost.yaml
archive with questions and answers of Proust.
